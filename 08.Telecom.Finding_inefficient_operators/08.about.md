### 08. Telecom. Finding inefficient operators.

__Description__
- Our customer is a platform «Callme», which supplies different services regarding VoIP (software, internet call channels, hardware etc.), the ultimate clients are the callcenters. Callcenters hire their staff - operators - to make outgoing calls and receive incoming calls from abonents (private individuals, companies etc - all depending on the business demand and circumstances). Each callceneter has its own incoming/outcoming calls' ratio according to its situation and requirements.

- The customer has a need to learn how to isolate inefficient operators using special algorithms, which in the future can be sold to customers (callcenters) as a new service. We are required to analyze the available data on calls and develop such an algorithm.

__Tools & experience__
- stats
- matplotlib 
- numpy 
- pandas 
- os 
- mathematics & logics in analysis 

__Steps__
1. Uploading and checking data for duplicates, omissions.
2. Elimination of data errors, filling in gaps, output of the main parameters of the 1st dataset.
3. Compilation of the algorithm of the program (decomposition of the problem).
4. Application of the algorithm for multiple tasks/metrics.
5. Formulation and verification of statistical hypotheses regarding the variability of numerical parameters at different time intervals of the dataset.
6. Conclusions, presentation, dashboard.

__Conclusions__
Analysis of inefficient operators:
- Research 1: A lot of missed incoming calls. 6 callcenters were found, which have 7 "abnormal" operators.
- Research 2: Long waiting for a response on incoming external calls. 90 callcenters were found with 144 "abnormal" operators.
- Research 3: Too few outgoing calls. 67 callcenters were found with 150 "abnormal" operators.
- Research 4: Too short or too long conversations with incoming outdoor calls. 31 callcenters were found with 44 "abnormal" operators.
- Research 5: Conversations that are too short or too long for outgoing outdoor calls. 37 callcenters were found with 56 "abnormal" operators.
- In the five studies, including intersections, 117 (38%) callcenters were found, with 314 (29%) "abnormal" operators.

Statistical research:
- Fluctuations in the number of operators in the 1st and 2nd two-week intervals according to Mann-Whitney test are statistically the same.
- The average number of operators in the 1st and 2nd two-week intervals according to T-test are statistically equal.
- Nevertheless, according to Z-test, the ratio of lost calls to the total number of calls in these two periods is significantly different.

Recommendations for the client:
- correct the export of operator IDs to integer format instead of float.
- double-check the correctness of the classification of calls as missed.
- if possible, try to link each missed call with the ID of a specific operator (possibly a group of operators). Ideally, each missed call should have its "owner".
- increase the amount of information collected, including disabling data aggregation. The more incoming information, the more "intelligent" metrics can be.
- depending on the new data that has appeared, increase the number of tests for operator inefficiency (in this work, 5 tests have been done, and as many as possible, for example, client might add the ratio of missed calls to accepted ones for each operator). 
- client can add reporting on the work of the callcenter as a whole, for example, the ratio of missed calls to accepted calls for the callcenter or the average call time for each callcenter.
- if there is a system which finds inefficient operators, then why not to create a similar one that will look for the most effective ones? Then callcenters could use data from the two systems to organize transfer of best practice to lagging operators (internal training), as well as to encourage their more efficient employees.
